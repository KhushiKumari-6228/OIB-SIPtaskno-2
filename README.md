# OIB-SIPtaskno-2
This repository is for the java development internship at OASIS INFOBYTE task no. 2.
This code is for the game "Guess the Number."
This generates a random no. from 0 to 100.
This Game Takes number between 1 to 100 from the  user and matches with the random number generated 
if the number matches with the random no. then the user won.
otherwise will give hint to the user to enter either larger or smaller no.
